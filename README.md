# MVP-Movie


In this application i used API tmdb, for load movies, in this app we have the ability to view info about the movie(poster, release date and overview).
If we start app and a load data is succeful, we saving their in database, next time you start app and if there is no internet, we'll see the same movies, because we load their in database
